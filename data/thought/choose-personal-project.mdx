title: Hereâ€™s How to Pick Ideas for Your Personal Project
---

Of course, you can choose any idea for your project; it can improve your skills and teach you essential things about building and launching a product. Usually, at work, you're given a project to work on. Despite that, you should know what you want to achieve, especially if this is about your professional development. For me, my goals usually include:

<br />

**Learn something new**

The best way to improve is to practice on purpose. I learned a lot about programming in
college, but I only really understood it once I started building things independently. At first, showing my work to others was embarrassing, but I learned that it's okay to make mistakes.

<br />
If you think about it, don't worry about impressing others. Just focus on regularly
showing your work. You will eventually see your progress overtime and whether there
is any improvement.

<br />

**Build something useful**

Personal projects are the perfect way to test out business ideas. Launching something
you have total control over is astounding, even if you don't plan to start a business. You can improve your coding and design, marketing, and business skills.

<br />

The best personal projects are the ones that solve a real problem. Make something that
you would use yourself. If you need help figuring out what to build,think about the tools you use daily. What could be better about them? What could be added to make them more valuable? Or something that many people need but has yet to exist.
