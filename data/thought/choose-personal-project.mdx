title: Here's How to Choose a Personal Project
---

Of course, you can choose any project you want, it can make your skills better, and teach you important stuff about building and launching a product. But, they're not always easy. Usually, at work, you're given a project to work on. But when you're on your own, you should know what you want to achieve. My goals usually are:

**Learn something new**

The best way to get better at something is to practice on purpose. In college, I learned a lot about programming, but I didn't really understand it until I started building things on my own. At first, i felt it was embarrasing to show my work to others, but I learned that it's okay to make mistakes.

If you choose this path, don't worry about impressing others. Just focus on regularly
showing your work.

**Build something useful**

Personal project are perfect sample for trying out business ideas. Even if you don't plan to start a business, it's really cool to launch something that you had total control over. You get to improve not only your coding skills, but also your design, marketing, and business skills.

The best personal projects are the ones that solve a real problem. Make something that you would use yourself. If you're not sure what to build, think about the tools you use every day. What could be better about them? What could be added to make them more useful? Or something that a lot of people need but doesn't exist yet.
