title: Trust Me, It's Better When You Use No More Than Two Typefaces
---

So many design professional call "font" as typeface. So, to make it look professional, I will use "typeface" instead of "font".

<br />
Using only two typeface, one for big titles and another for normal text, and using
bold or italic styles for emphasis instead of changing typefaces. This keeps things
clear for users and avoids too much visual mess.

<br />

Anyway, many designers make the mistake of using too many different typefaces in their designs. Ah, of course you can use more than two typefaces, but you need to be careful. If you use more than two typefaces, you need to make sure that they are different enough to be easily distinguishable. If they are too similar, it can be confusing for users. <b> Instead of changing to a completely different typefaces, you can make text stand out by using medium font size and so on </b>. This way, you can keep the design clean and easy to read. Also, you can use different sizes, colors, and spacing to create hierarchy and make the text more interesting.

<br />

For some context, having to many typefaces makes things look messt and cofuses the reader. Also, some fancy typefaces designed for brand might look cool but hard to read.

<br />

<b>So, what's the point?</b>

- Use only two typefaces maximum
- Use one typeface for heading and titles
- Use another typeface for body text
