<b id="project-overview">Project Overview</b>

This project originated from one of my university classes, specifically in UI/UX design. The primary objective was to design a user interface using Figma and subsequently implement the design into code. Essentially, it entails creating a static web application without any backend services at this stage.

<b id="lessons-learned">What I've Learned</b>

Perhaps you're wondering why I chose Nuxt.js (a framework for Vue.js, akin to
React.js's Next.js). During the time I worked on this project, I was an intern
at PrivyID, where I served as a full-stack Software Engineer Intern. The tech
stack they utilized predominantly involved Nuxt.js. Given my relatively novice
status in front-end development, I decided to undertake this slicing project
using Nuxt.js. It seemed like a valuable opportunity to familiarize myself
further with the framework while preparing for tasks related to my internship.

<b id="future-improvements">What's Next?</b>

What comes next is that I'll be focusing on the backend tasks. Additionally, I plan to overhaul several components that, in my assessment, lack optimal user interface and experience. This involves refining elements to ensure a more user-friendly and seamless interaction for our users.
